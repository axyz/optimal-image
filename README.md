# optimal-image

## Development
- For the first time you want to run, you can run the `make init` to intialize the `githooks`

- Once you have `cargo` available locally, build the package as
```bash
cargo run
```
- Now you can verify the tool  by comparing 2 images as below:
```
./target/optimizer aaa.png bbb.png
```
